# Battleship
Battleship is a classic board game in which two players place their ships on a grid and try to locate and sink each other’s fleet. The game ends when one player sinks all of the opponent's ships. In this version of the game, the second player is the computer, which randomly selects a position to “fire” at and then checks if it has already shot there.

To create the "Battleship" program, I am using Python along with the Tkinter library and the SQLite3 module.

Tkinter is Python’s standard user interface library, providing a simple way to create windowed applications. Tkinter offers many built-in UI elements such as buttons, labels, and text fields, which facilitate building an interactive interface for the game. The choice of Tkinter was driven by its simplicity.

SQLite3 is an embedded database module in Python, meaning it requires no separate server or setup. It is easy to use and well-suited for simple applications like "Battleship," where we need to store user login information and game scores. With its simplicity and flexibility, SQLite3 is ideal for managing small datasets in desktop applications.
